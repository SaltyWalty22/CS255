Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass Project was able creating an online system where driving students could purchase a package (1-3) that would help them pass their driver’s test. The 3 packages provided driving classes with an instructor and package 3 provided access to online resources.

What did you do particularly well?

I feel like I understood the customer's needs and did a good job depicting their needs in the diagrams created.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could redo an document it would be the jargon I used to describe the customers needs. I don’t feel like I did a good job using terminology the customer would understand assuming they don’t have a IT background. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's need by creating use cases diagrams and understanding the needs of the customers. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing as they are the ones who are using the product and if we don’t meet their needs out project it will fail in the long run.  

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The UML diagrams are a great way to approach the software designing cycle. They break down the parts of the software and make it easy to understand what needs to be created to get the end goal accomplished. I would use an Agile process to analyze and design a system as it would allow multiple iterates of the product and make sure the customer is happy with the end product.
